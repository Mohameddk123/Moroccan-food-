                <div>
                    <p>Madrid is a vibrant city with an array of fun things to do, both day and night. It’s filled with lots of <span class="the-red-span">great neighbourhoods, mouth-watering cuisine</span> and a great <span class="the-red-span">nightlife scene</span>. Madrid’s amazing <span class="the-red-span">public transport system</span> makes getting around easy and convenient and the<span class="the-red-span"> Spanish healthcare system</span> is one of the best in Europe. This city is perfect for those relocating to study abroad, find an internship or start a new job.</p>
                    <p>Moving to Madrid is definitely a great choice. During that move, one of the most important decisions you will have to make is deciding <span class="the-black-span">where </span>and <span class="the-black-span">how</span> you want to live. When it comes to finding the perfect apartment for rent in Madrid, most young internationals choose to rent a room in a shared apartment or to rent an apartment in Madrid together with others. Another popular option to look for student housing in Madrid is renting a room in one of the many student residences in Madrid. This option however is a lot more expensive than renting a single room in a shared apartment.</p>
                    <p>The cost to rent a room in a shared apartment in Madrid <sapn class="the-black-span">ranges currently from 300€ to 700€ per month</sapn> depending mostly on the area you would like to live in as well as the style of the flat itself.<span class="the-black-span"> The average rate for renting a room runs around 475€/month</span>. Be sure to always check if utilities (known here as “gastos“) are included in the monthly rent, or if they require additional payment. Both types of rental contracts are very common in Madrid.</p>
                    <p class="different">To help you<span class="the-black-span"> determine your available budget</span> for your time in Madrid, check out our<span class="the-red-span"> cost of living Madrid</span> guide. It will help you understand general prices in Spain for rent,<span class="the-red-span"> public transport Madrid, cell phone & internet, health insurance</span>, food & leisure and more.</p>

                    <p class="p">Throughout this guide we will provide you with detailed information and recommendations for <span class="the-red-span">student housing options, how to find your room to rent</span> and what to be aware of when it comes to <span class="the-red-span">signing your contract</span>.</p>
                    <p class="p">Firstly, we do recommend you<span class="the-black-span"> start your search online before traveling to Madrid</span>. The reason being that student accommodation in Madrid is in high demand basically any time of the year. However this is especially true from August to February as many international students or young professionals relocating to Madrid rent their room online before arriving to the city. Resulting in most of the best offers being reserved and taken very early.</p>
                    <p class="p">When searching online, it is recommendable to rent a room through a<span class="the-black-span"> trusted rental agency</span> or a <span class="the-black-span">secure housing in Madrid search platform</span> – although they typically charge a commission rate of up to one month of rent. Skip ahead for a list of<span class="the-red-span"> popular rental agencies as well as secure housing search platforms</span> offering student rooms and student apartments for rent in Madrid.</p>
                    <p class="p">That being said, let’s get started by having a look at all the most recommended neighbourhoods where young internationals typically rent a room or apartment for their time in Madrid.</p>

                       <p class="p-summary">Puerta del Sol, or The Sun Gate is the literal center of Madrid and home to Madrid’s most popular meeting-point – the “Bear Statue” or as it is called in Spanish, “El Oso y el Madroño”. Sol also marks Kilometer Zero, meaning that all of Madrid’s building numbers and highways stem from here. It’s literally the middle-point of the entire Iberian Peninsula. Sol is also very central when it comes to transportation, shopping and tourist attractions. All of Madrid’s most popular shops are located within walking distance of Sol, and there are plenty of restaurants, both new and old, to dine at. Plaza Mayor is only a 5 minute walk from Sol and Calle Mayor will conveniently bring you to the Prado Museum or Royal Palace.</p>
                       <p class="p-summary">If you have the chance to rent a student room or student apartment in the area around Sol, we definitely recommend to go ahead although prices to rent a room will be higher due its incredible centric location.</p>

                        <p class="p-summary">Malasaña is known as the hippest part of town. It’s home to tiny boutiques, bustling cafes, trendy restaurants, stylish plazas and cobbled streets. Making it a fun and very popular area for students, young expats and artists to live in. Its main shopping street – Calle Fuencarral – runs parallel to Calle Hortaleza, connecting Malasaña and Chueca together physically and culturally.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The neighbourhood is also home to a rich history. Its main plaza, Plaza de Dos de Mayo, was home to the battle in 1802 when the Madrileños rose against Napoleon. Malasaña was also home to Madrid’s ground-breaking experimental movement known as “<span class="the-red-span">La Movida Madrileña</span>”, which came alive after the fall of Franco’s dictatorship in the late 1970’s. The highly drug-ridden and sexually-open movement took place in the 80’s and went well into the 90’s, leaving a heavy imprint on Malasaña and Chueca as well. Remnants of graffiti can be seen as you walk through its tiny streets. Many young people come to Malasaña to enjoy the environment. This makes Malasaña a good idea for international living!</p>
                        <p>If you are lucky you can find moderately priced apartments for rent in this popular area.</p>

                        <p class="p-summary">Chueca is a only stones throw away from Gran Vía and one of the best places to live and go out in Madrid. Its main street is Calle Hortaleza, a street that connects more modern with Madrid with the city center. Chueca is undoubtedly one of the trendiest nightlife destinations in the city. During the day, Chueca is home to fabulous restaurants, outdoor terraces and boutiques, as well as an entire street of shoe stores on Calle Agusto Figueroa. Also along this street is the Mercado de San Antón, a 3-story gourmet food market offering all types of delicious food and a fantastic rooftop bar.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>But most importantly, Chueca is Madrid’s most predominate LGBTQ+ neighbourhood. Many of its residents belong to the community and as a result the barrio offers a certain flair that you won’t find anywhere else in the city. Chueca is the proud host of one of the world’s largest<span class="the-red-span"> Gay Pride Festival</span> that attracts thousands of visitors every year during Pride season. Due to its mix of edgy and high-end nightclubs, restaurants, bars, stores and ambiance, Chueca is easy to fall in love with.</p>
                        <p>To rent a room in this great and safe area is definitely a great idea if you would like to enjoy Madrid to the fullest.</p>

                        <p class="p-summary">Huertas is colloquially named after its main street – Calle Huertas – but officially, its name is Barrio de las Letras. Its name stems from its history as the home of many famous artists, writers and creatives over the centuries – such as Cervantes, Quevedo, Lope de Vega and Hemingway. It’s considered as part of Madrid’s medieval quarter and this just adds to the soul of the whole area. You’ll find many art, interior design and antique fairs throughout the year – especially in the spring when the weather is at its best.</p>
                        <p class="p-summary">Aside from its history, Huertas is considered to be one of the most popular places to go out in the center. It’s only five minutes walking from Sol, and the perfect place to start your night. Huertas is covered with all types of bars, some more upscale than others, and a lot of great restaurants. There are many other little streets to discover, such as Calle Leon which has fun bars, old-school delicatessens, boutiques and more. Huertas street leads to the famous “<span class="the-red-span">Paseo del Prado</span>”, which is full of museums, thus deepening the areas connection to art and culture.</p>
                        <p class="p-summary">If you are thinking to rent a student apartment or a student room in Huertas, make sure to rent a room ideally in a quiet side street and not on the main streets of the neighbourhood to avoid lots of noise at night.</p>

                        <p class="p-summary">La Latina feels like a pueblo within the city of Madrid. This neighbourhood is very unique and it’s close community feel really sets itself apart from the rest of the city. The streets are always pulsing with people and there is always something going on. La Latina boasts the city’s oldest architecture (hence the name, the Latin Quarter) and some of its finest cuisine. Especially beautiful are the small alleyways nestled between 18th century buildings, as well as the tiny streets where restaurants set up summer patios. On Sundays La Latina’s most famous street, La Cava Baja, turns into Madrid’s “place to be.” This charming street is lined with tiny bars serving up cañas (draft beer), wines and tapas. It’s typical to go here on a Sunday afternoon after visiting the city’s largest flea market, “<span class="the-red-span">El Rastro</span>”.</p>
                        <p class="p-summary">Housing in this area is pricey but it is a great neighbourhood for internationals as commuting is easy and its a well known area where local and internationals mingle. Rent your room in La Latina and get to experience the true Madrid.</p>

                        <p class="p-summary">Lavapiés with its underground and rugged feel, is fast becoming one of Madrid’s trendiest neighbourhoods. It was home to an influx of immigrants for many years, mainly from Africa and Middle Eastern countries. Once considered the dodgier side of town, Lavapiés is now being embraced for its edgy culture, diverse cuisine and alternative (oft-artsy) nightlife. Just one stop from Sol, Lavapiés is the perfect place to check out Madrid’s changing personality. Lavapiés is often called Curry Row because it is lined with fun and cheap and delicious Indian restaurants. The other famous street in Lavapiés, C/ Argumosa, is lined with hipster bars and tantalizing outdoor seating areas. It stretches right to Atocha street behind the “<span class="the-red-span">Reina Sofia Museum</span>”.</p>
                        <p class="p-summary">Due to its development over the last years, Lavapiés has become a safe place to rent an apartment in the very centre of the city at a lower price than surrounding neighbourhoods, so it might be a great choice to look for available student housing in the area.</p>

Madrid’s biggest public university, La Complutense, is located in the area as well as many others like Saint Louis University, San Pablo CEU, Cunef, Suffolk University. The area is packed with bars, shops, restaurants and clubs. Its main street, Calle Princesa, is full of shops such as Zara and El Corte Inglés. In fact, Calle Princesa turns into Gran Vía right after Plaza de España. It’s also a relatively quick walk from Sol (anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes depending on where you start), and it is right next to the two most lively neighbourhoods, Malasaña and Chueca. Commuting to the city centre with public transport or bike is quick and easy.</p>
                        <p class="p-summary">All this makes Moncloa & Argüelles a great choice for international students to look for an apartment or room for rent in Madrid. The average rent for a room will most likely be cheaper there too.</p>

Inside<span class="the-red-span"> Retiro Park </span>you can enjoy plenty of beautiful attractions including the glass palace, rose gardens and green lawns.

It is much quieter than the other neighbourhoods mentioned on this list and filled with large, upscale family style apartments. As with most upscale neighbourhoods you will find there all the high-end stores, top-notch restaurants and prime real estate. However, chic nightclubs and lounges aside, you will also find hidden gems. Salamanca is a neighbourhood where many people live and they have mom and pop shops and friendly bars.</p>

It also has quaint plazas such as the Plaza de Chamberí and Plaza de Olavide; the latter being a popular place for tapas and beer on one of their various terraces.

                    <p>Madrid is a big city with a wide range of available housing options for young internationals. However finding the perfect apartment for rent can be difficult as the market is very competitive. As briefly mentioned before, the most common option is renting a room in a shared apartment with other young internationals or Spanish locals.</p>
                    <p>Besides that, you can also choose to live in one of the many student residences in Madrid, with a Spanish family (known as “homestay“), or try find a studio apartment (1 bedroom apartment) for yourself. Some important topics to bear in mind when searching through these housing types include:</p>

Apartments for rent start with 2 bedrooms and can get up to more than 15 bedrooms per apartment. Sharing a flat with others is a great and easy way to make new friends but also might be noisier and you would need to agree on sharing the “house work“.</p>

It will however be much more costly than sharing a flat and you will have less social connections especially at the beginning. Nonetheless, renting a studio apartment in Madrid is a very popular option. Do keep in mind that these 1 bedroom apartments are not so common in Madrid, making the hunt a bit more complicated.</p>

                        <p>A third option is to rent a student room in one of the many student residences in Madrid. You usually have the choice to either rent a single bedroom or share with someone else in a double bedroom. Living in a student residence is more costly than sharing an apartment but it puts you in contact with many other like minded peers. Also many student residences will have a library to study, a gym to work-out and chill-out areas to hang out with your friends.</p>

                            <p class="p-2D-type">Another great option is to <span class="the-red-span">live with a Spanish family</span> during your time in Madrid. On the one hand you will get to try typical Spanish foods in an authentic way (host families will often cook for their students), learn about Spanish family culture firsthand and live in safe and secure residency.</p>
                            <p class="p-2D-type">On the other hand, living in a <span class="the-red-span">homestay</span> will most likely result in less independence. You will need to follow the rules of your host family, which may include curfews or restrictions when it comes to friends visiting. Additionally, many of these families will have apartments located outside the city center.</p>
                            <p class="p-2D-type">If you are interested in living with a Spanish family we recommend you get in touch with<span class="the-red-span"> Your Family in Madrid</span>, one of Madrid’s most known homestay companies.</p>
